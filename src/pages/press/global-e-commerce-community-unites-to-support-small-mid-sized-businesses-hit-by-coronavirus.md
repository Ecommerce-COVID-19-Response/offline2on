***AUSTIN, TX -- April 1st, 2020 --*** Today, nearly 1,100 e-commerce professionals from around the world came together to launch Offline2On.com, a community-led initiative to help small- and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) get online fast and optimize online sales in the face of the growing coronavirus pandemic. Spanning experts across all aspects of commerce and leading e-commerce platforms, the initiative connects businesses with the resources, developers, platforms, and partners they need to take immediate action.

Small- and mid-sized companies are bearing the brunt of the worldwide containment measures, with lost foot traffic, plummeting demand and revenue, and growing fears of making payroll and of keeping the lights on. As most SMBs don’t have full time IT staff, there is an immediate need to connect these brick-and-mortar businesses with expertise to get them online fast.

Over the course of 72 hours, a simple idea became a reality as the global e-commerce community rallied together to build resources and launch Offline2On.com. The hub centralizes unbiased information and assistance from e-commerce agencies, technologists, marketers, warehouses, shipping logistic companies, and business professionals representing over 500 organizations across 20 time zones. 

Nearly 1,000 professionals are available to help those who are unfamiliar with the process of creating an online store or who need help optimizing their online sales. Among the e-commerce platforms represented are BigCommerce, Magento and Shopify.

*“As small business owners ourselves, we know the gut-wrenching reality these businesses are facing as states and countries introduce lockdowns. We couldn’t sit idly by and knew that our colleagues in the commerce community were all looking for ways to help,”* said ShipperHQ CEO Karen Baker, and The Taproom CEO Kelly Vaughn, founding organizers of Offline2On.com. 

> “Businesses can use all the help in the world right now to try and get an online store up and running. We're immensely proud of how the e-commerce community is rallying to help.”
