### What is Offline2On?

Offline2On is a community of over 1000 experts who want to help bring small and medium businesses online. We specialize in e-commerce (online sales; think Amazon), marketing, advertising, website creation, and much more. If you want to start selling your products and services online, you’re in the right place!

### Why are we doing this?

Small and medium businesses form the backbone of the global economy. Some are experiencing pain, and some have already shut down. By pulling together now, we hope to help as many businesses as possible survive these uniquely difficult circumstances. We also hope to build and maintain connections between business owners and service providers to help everyone come out stronger on the other side.  

### What countries are you supporting as part of this initiative?

Initially our primary focus is on Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. We have support for Europe, New Zealand, and India in the pipeline. We do encourage agencies from all over to volunteer so that we can expand our presence.

### Is the help being offered free or paid?

We have a standard list of free offerings for those looking to set up a new website as well as those who currently have websites on BigCommerce and Shopify. These offerings will connect you to an agency to bring you online.

Other services are free or paid, depending on the nature of the work you need done. Many of the companies we work with are offering discounts, promotions, and in some cases, free or at-cost service packages.

### I already have a website; can I still get help and support?

Yes! Different businesses have different problems, and need different support. We treat everyone individually based on the information you provide when you ask us for help. If you already know exactly what help you need, feel free [contact us](/merchants) to find service providers who can help you!

### Will I own my website, and will there be ongoing fees?

This is your choice. Depending on your skill set and business goals, you may want to partner with an e-commerce agency and use their services, or have them build you a website that you would own and run yourself. There are usually fees of some kind, but a number of agencies are currently offering discounts and promotions.

### What resources do I need to run my website?

You just need an internet connection and a computer, that’s it!

### How are you allocating agencies to assist business owners?

Agencies who agree to offer the services will be vetted based on their areas of expertise and their location with respect to the business owner.

### I’m an agency, how can I help?

Fill out the [agencies form](/agencies) and you will be vetted and placed in the directory. You will then be matched with requests that align with your service offerings, platform specifications, and locale.

### How can I get involved with the offline2on.com initiative?

We are looking for help in marketing and press release distribution, as well as expertise in locales and verticals for our resource pages. Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/6jLzQpRUvuwmJtdN8) and we will be in touch.
