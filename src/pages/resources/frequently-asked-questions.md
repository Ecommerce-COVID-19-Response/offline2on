### What is Offline2On?
Offline2On is a community of over 1000 experts who want to help bring small and medium businesses online. We specialize in e-commerce (online sales; think Amazon), marketing, advertising, website creation, and much more. If you want to start selling your products and services online, you’re in the right place!

### Why are we doing this?
Small and medium businesses form the backbone of the global economy. Some are experiencing pain, and some have already shut down. By pulling together now, we hope to help as many businesses as possible survive these uniquely difficult circumstances. We also hope to build and maintain connections between business owners and service providers to help everyone come out stronger on the other side. 

### Is the help being offered free or paid?
Some services are free, while others are paid; it depends on the nature of the work you need done. Many of the companies we work with are offering discounts, promotions, and in some cases free or at-cost service packages. 
 
### I already have a website; can I still get help and support?
Yes! Different businesses have different problems, and need different support. We treat everyone individually based on the list of struggles you provide when you ask us for help. If you already know exactly what help you need, feel free to scan our business directory[Link to businesses directory] yourself to find service providers who can help you!

### Will I own my website, and are there ongoing fees?
This is somewhat your choice. Depending on your skill set and business goals, you may want to partner with an e-commerce agency and use their services, or have them build you a website that you would own and run yourself. There are usually fees of some kind, but a number of agencies are offering discounts and promotions during the pandemic. We are here to get you up and online right now!

### What resources do I need to run my website? 
You just need an internet connection and a computer, that’s it!

### I’m an agency; how can I help?
Fill out the Agencies Form [link to form] and you will be vetted and placed in the directory. You will then be matched with requests that align with your service offerings, platform specifications, and locale.
