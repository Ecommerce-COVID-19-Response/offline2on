### What is Offline2On?

Offline2On started as a community of nearly 1,400 e-commerce experts who wanted to help bring small and medium businesses online. Now that many companies are adjusting to the ‘new normal’, Offline2On has converted into a resource center for businesses. Please visit our Resources Page for more information.

### Why are we doing this?

Small and medium businesses form the backbone of the global economy. Some are experiencing pain, and some have already shut down. By pulling together now, we hope to help as many businesses as possible survive these uniquely difficult circumstances. We also hope to build and maintain connections between business owners and service providers to help everyone come out stronger on the other side.  

### I’m an agency, how can I help?

We originally had a form to complete to be added to our directory and match agencies with businesses. Now that O2O has converted into a resource center, we are no longer accepting agency support. But thank you for thinking of us and those merchants in need.

### How can I get involved with the offline2on.com initiative?

We originally had a form for interested volunteers to complete. Now that O2O has converted into a resource center for small businesses, we are no longer accepting volunteers. We wish we could’ve worked with you prior to now.

### I have further questions, how do I get in touch?

Since O2O has converted into a resource center, we no longer have the need for volunteers. O2O is now strictly a resource center for small businesses.
