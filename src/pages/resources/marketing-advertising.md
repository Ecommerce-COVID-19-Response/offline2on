### Benefits Of Marketing & Advertising For Small Businesses
As you venture into an online business, you’ll need to get the word out to your current shoppers. Even if you are a community leader, expanding your customer base beyond the neighborhood can drive your sales substantially higher.

To become more visible, you have two broad options—marketing and advertising. Marketing often appeals directly to customers’ lives. You will seek to address their concerns, educate them about products, and solve problems they face in their daily life. Advertising is an excellent way to showcase product benefits and comparisons, and other direct-to-customer benefits. 

When you invest in one or both of these avenues, you can expect to see more visitors to your website and social media channels, more conversations with potential customers, and more sales as a result. 

### Common Examples Of Marketing And Advertising 
Millennials have taken over as the primary working-age group and social media is one of the best places to get in front of their eyes. Facebook, Instagram, and other networks offer the ability to upload pictures, videos, and text posts where you can share tips, tricks, and advice with them. Keep your posts relevant to their needs and things you might find entertaining. 

Advertising works very well to supplement your marketing efforts as well as highlight any reputation you have. Advertising on both search engines such as Google or Bing and social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram is a great place to start. 

Things to highlight with advertising include:
- Product benefits or price reductions and promotions
- Excellent reviews or influential testimonials
- Events or pre-existing reputation advantages 

Guerilla marketing is a way of integrating yourself with your audience, educating them about a need they may not know they have, and showing them that you can solve their problem. It also tends to involve entertaining them in creative ways. Search Google for “[Flash Mob](https://www.delnext.com/blog/en/most-famous-flash-mobs/)” and “[Sopranos Taxi Marketing](http://ta-guerillamarketing.blogspot.com/2011/01/sopranos-dead-mafia-in-cab.html)” to see a couple of examples. The same theories can be recreated online.

When we are all stuck at home, we need connection now, more than ever. Look for ways that your business can help people connect from home. Whether you’re selling coffee via local delivery and offering small coffee-side chats online or you’re selling beauty supplies and offering free tutorial chats over Skype, getting involved can go a long way in these distanced times. 

### Setting Up Google My Business
Google My Business provides you with visibility on the world’s largest search engine. Here, you can list a link to your website, a photo for your business, street address, contact information, and even a short description of your business. One other key benefit to listing on Google My Business is the review system, which shows how you stack up against your competition
