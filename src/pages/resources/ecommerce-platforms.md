subtitle: Choose an e-commerce platform
---
To be clear, there isn’t one platform that is perfect for every business so as you review the platforms listed below, keep your business in mind. 

It is important to remember that there may be trade-offs in terms of ease of use and functionality. Most e-commerce platforms will include the basics you’ll need like catalog management, payment processing, support for sales tax, and basic promotion functionality. Additionally, you’ll want to find a platform that you can grow with once things get back to normal. 

When it comes to choosing a platform there are several different factors you should consider.

**Is the platform available in my country?**

Not all platforms are available in all countries. Does it support all the languages that you need to support? Do you need to display or transact in multiple currencies?

**How quickly can I get up and running?**

The size and complexity of your business will have an impact on how quickly you can get online. For example, if your business does a lot of business-to-business (B2B) and you have complex price lists that vary by customer group, or if you need to set different product prices based on currency, it will take longer to get up and running.

Do you have access to support if you get stuck? Will you need a developer to handle some features and if so, do you have access to a developer? If not, that’s ok! Just fill out [this form](/merchants) to get some help

**Does the platform have everything I need?**

Not every platform will have the features that you need to run your business. Some platforms may work right out of the box; others may require additional customizations. Most e-commerce platforms allow customizations in the form of third-party plugins. Investigate what plugins are available for the features that you need.

## Platforms to Consider

### Small and Medium Business Platforms

Below is a short list of the most popular e-commerce platforms that merchants new to selling online should consider. The list is broken into two main categories based on business size.

Selecting the right platform can feel a little overwhelming so if you feel stuck there are a few things you can do:

* Setup a free trial and get a feel for any platforms you think would be a good fit
* Talk with an agency about your needs
* Contact a representative at any of the listed platforms to learn more

For these platforms, we’ve highlighted the following features:

* **Catalog size:** Catalog size is the number of products, including the number of individual products and product variations, such as size, color, etc.
* **Hosting included:** Many platforms include the cost of hosting as part of the price. Generally, Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms will include hosting while Open Source platforms will not.
* **Theme builder/editor:** The platform allows business owners to make changes to the look and feel of the site without requiring a developer.
* **Coupons/discounts:** The platform supports the ability to have automatic cart level discounts or promotion codes.
* **24/7 support:** The platform includes 24/7 technical support through phone or chat.
* **Point of sale (POS) integrations:** A point of sale system is how customers pay for your products when they are physically in your shop. Many platforms either include a native point of sale system or support integrations with popular point of sale systems.
