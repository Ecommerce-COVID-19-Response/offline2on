# Figure Out What Products you Want to Sell Online r

You will need to determine which of your products you will list online (your “product catalog”). You do not need to include every product you sell, especially when starting out. We recommend starting with your bestsellers, products that are in demand. Once you are up and running, you can add additional products to your catalog.

For each product, include the following information:
- Product title
- Price
- Description
- Additional specifications (dimensions, for example)
- Selling or shipping limitations (if applicable)
- A photo (today’s mobile phones are excellent and can be used in a pinch)

You may also consider selling gift certificates; these can be a great way to increase your cash flow short term.

You can also let your customers know that you have additional products not yet listed; provide a phone number and an email address for them to reach out if they cannot find what they need.

## Determine Your Shipping Strategy 

One of the reasons you are looking to get online in a hurry is to reach your customers who were once able to do business by coming in your shop. Now, you will need to ship to them. There are several aspects to sorting out a shipping strategy.

### Where will you ship?
Will you be shipping locally only, domestically, or internationally?

### How will you pay for shipping?
You will need to decide how to pay for shipping. There are several options here:
- Have the customer pay in full. This would mean that you will get a shipping rate in real time from a carrier and pass that on to the customer
- Offer flat rate shipping. This is a simpler method, but you will need to determine what price to charge that is appealing to both your customers and your bottom line.
- Offer free shipping. You could build the shipping price into the cost of your products. In today’s world of Amazon Prime, this type of offer is very tempting to customers.
- Will you need to charge a handling fee?
- Will you offer expedited shipping? For example, if you sell perishable goods.


### Identify carrier services that are available to you.
If you are only shipping within your municipality, you may be able to handle the deliveries yourself. If you plan to ship further, then you will need to select a carrier.

You will want to consider any local movement restrictions when choosing a carrier that may affect their ability to reach all of your customers. Also take into account that there may be delays with all carriers.

### Determine the amount of time it will take you to get your products shipped. 
This is called your “lead time” and you will want to make sure this is clear to customers on your site somewhere. For example, if a customer orders a product today, then you will need to determine how long it will take you to package the product and get it shipped.

### Write a shipping policy.
Once you have determined how you plan to ship your products, you should write a shipping policy for customers so that they know the following:

- How long it takes to ship items
- Delivery times
- Shipping method

There are plenty of resources online that will provide you with a free shipping policy template. Here are a few:

- [Easyship Shipping Policy Generator](https://www.easyship.com/shipping-policy-generator)
- [Shipbob Free Shipping Policy Template](https://www.shipbob.com/blog/shipping-policy-template/)

In most cases, depending on the platform you choose to use for your website, the platform will provide some basic shipping capabilities such as charging a flat rate or offering free shipping. 

They may even offer easy access to live shipping rates from domestic carriers. This is more common in the US than other countries but there are usually plenty of integrations for major carriers worldwide on most platforms.

## Plan for Sales Tax 

You may be required to collect sales tax on online sales, depending on your locality.

## United States
In the United States, forty-five states and Washington DC all have sales tax. States, counties/parishes, cities, and other “special taxing districts” can all charge sales tax. This is why the sales tax amount you charge or pay is sometimes an odd number like 7.125%. 
 
When you make a sale at your brick and mortar business, you charge the same state + county + city + special sales tax rate to every person who walks in the door. However, when you sell online, this rate often changes. 
 
In most cases, the sales tax rate you are required to charge depends on the sales tax rate at the buyer’s address. So, if you make an in-person sale to someone at your store’s location in Atlanta, Georgia you would charge that person the 8.9% Atlanta sales tax rate. But if you ship an item from your store to someone in Albany, Georgia, you would only charge that customer the 8% Albany sales tax rate.
 
Sound confusing? Thankfully, most online sales platforms like Magento, BigCommerce, Shopify and more will allow you to automatically set up sales, or VAT or GRT tax collection. 

Right now, the most important thing you can do is ensure you are collecting sales tax from your customers in the state where your brick and mortar store is located. This means you won’t later end up having to pay sales tax out of pocket. But there is more to sales tax when selling online. If you have questions, check out the E-commerce Seller’s Guide to Online Sales Tax.


## Europe
In Europe, this tax is often called Value Added Tax (VAT). In other countries it may be called Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) or have another name. The one thing that these taxes share in common is that they are generally collected from the buyer at the point of sale and then periodically passed on to the governing body.

## Choose a Platform 

To be clear, there isn’t one platform that is perfect for every business so as you review the platforms listed below, keep your business in mind. 

It’s important to remember that there may be trade-offs in terms of ease of use and functionality. Most e-commerce platforms will include the basics you’ll need like catalog management, payment processing, support for sales tax, and basic promotion functionality. Additionally, you’ll want to find a platform that you can grow with once things get back to normal. 

When it comes to choosing a platform there are several different factors you should consider. 

### Is the platform available in my country?
Not all platforms are available in all countries. Does it support all the languages that you need to support? Do you need to display or transact in multiple currencies?

### How quickly can I get up and running?
The size and complexity of your business will have an impact on how quickly you can get online. For example, if your business does a lot of B2B and you have complex price lists that vary by customer group, or if you need to set different product prices based on currency, it will take longer to get up and running.

Do you have access to support if you get stuck? Will you need a developer to handle some features and if so, do you have access to a developer? If not, that’s ok! Just fill out this form to get some help.

### Does the platform have everything I need?
Not every platform will have the features that you need to run your business. Some platforms may work right out of the box; others may require additional customizations. Most e-commerce platforms allow customizations in the form of third-party plugins. Investigate what plugins are available for the features that you need

### Small and Medium Business Platforms
Below is a short list of the most popular e-commerce platforms that merchants new to selling online should consider. We’ve broken this list into two main categories based on the size of your business. For smaller merchants, these platforms are focused on getting up and running fast with the tools most small businesses need.

Selecting the right platform can feel a little overwhelming so if you feel stuck there are a few things you can do: 

- Setup a free trial and get a feel for any platforms you think would be a good fit
- Talk with an agency about your needs
- Contact a representative at any of the listed platforms to learn more
