Offline2On.com is a community-led, cross-platform initiative to support businesses in ramping their e-commerce efforts in the wake of COVID-19 by connecting merchants with the resources, developers, platforms, and partners they need to take action.

## What happened?
The world seemed to collapse on us a couple of weeks back here in the US. We were watching China, then it went to Italy, and before we know it COVID-19 was paralyzing all of us outside and inside our homes.

## Who are we?
We are a group collective made up of over 600 technologists in the eCommerce space. Across eCommerce platforms such as Shopify, BigCommerce and Magento. We are representing countries all around the world, hang around on twitter, and are the nerds (not all of us), those in the t-shirts, the laptops full of stickers, and the coding wizards.  

We also have amongst us though great minds, and some great talent in fields such as marketing, PR, events, logistics, to name a few.

Today though we stand as one, ready to help you rebuild.

These are difficult times, and we believe a time when you need people. What you also need is hope. We are here to support you.

## Our Purpose:
We have simple goals at this time:
1. Provide a centralized source of unbiased information to the retailers
2. Provide a place for retailers/shop owners to request help
3. Provide a place for eCommerce people to say they are available for help and skills etc
4. Connect helpers with those needing help with aim of offline customers online in < 1 week
5. Bring together the eCommerce community to discuss and attempt to resolve challenges around shipping, distribution, staffing and more

We want to get you back at work. In incredibly difficult conditions.
